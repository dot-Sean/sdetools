    "status_message": "The scanning tool did not find any instances of this vulnerability. The scanning tool can normally detect some instances of this vulnerability, but not all, for a number of possible reasons. For example, the scanning tool only detects this vulnerability in some of the supported languages/frameworks but not all, or it can only detect certain aspects of the vulnerability but not all. Note that a partial pass does not guarantee the absence of false negatives, and SD Elements recommends additional manual testing for high risk applications.",
