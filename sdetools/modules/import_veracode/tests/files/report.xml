The tainted data originated from an earlier call to javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getParameterValues.

Avoid dynamically constructing SQL queries. Instead, use parameterized prepared statements to prevent the database from interpreting the contents of bind variables as part of the query. Always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods.

In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods.

In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack.

The tainted data originated from earlier calls to java.sql.preparedstatement.executequery, javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparameter, java.sql.statement.executequery, and javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparametervalues. The tainted data is directed into an output stream returned by javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

The application populates the HTTP response with user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods.

The application populates the HTTP response with user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis. The first argument to println() contains tainted data from the variable printParameters. The tainted data originated from earlier calls to javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparameternames, and javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparametervalues. The tainted data is directed into an output stream returned by javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack.

XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack.

The tainted data originated from earlier calls to java.sql.preparedstatement.executequery, javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparameter, java.sql.statement.executequery, and javax.servlet.servletrequest.getparametervalues. The tainted data is directed into an output stream returned by javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

The application populates the HTTP response with user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis. The first argument to print() contains tainted data from the variable employee.getStartDate().

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response. The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods.

In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Use contextual escaping on all untrusted data before using it to construct any portion of an HTTP response.

The escaping method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data, otherwise it may not protect fully against the attack. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity escaping; if the data is being written to an attribute, use attribute escaping; etc. Both the OWASP ESAPI library for Java and the Microsoft AntiXSS library provide contextual escaping methods. For more details on contextual escaping, see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet. In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.
