Enforce this requirement by explicitly refusing plain-text requests for the login and authenticated portions of an application.\r\n\r\nThe classification of confidential data is dependent on application context, applicable laws, regulations and relevant security policies. Data including, but not limited to, authentication credentials, session ID, credit card information, and health data are confidential and must always be secured while in transit.\r\n\r\nNote: TLS is often generically referred to as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) since TLS is based on the SSL protocol. TLS, and specifically TLS v1.2, is much stronger since it addresses weaknesses found in earlier versions of TLS and SSL in general.",
